# COGS 118B Final Project: Clustering CLIP Embeddings

*Ada He, Laura Fleig, Sylvana Northrop*

Research question: Are semantic relationships preserved/coded in CLIP embeddings?

We performed hierarchical clustering on 100 randomly sampled images from the CIFAR-10 dataset (with even class distributions) to see if CLIP embeddings preserve semantic relationships.
